**A public accessor hands out a copy; the library reads the live object** — `get_config()` and `get_baggage()` copy, because a public getter documented "do not mutate" is a promise the caller's slip breaks silently, while `config._live_config()` and `context._live_baggage()` are the per-event reads, since `build_event` runs one to three config reads and one baggage read **per event** and a copy there allocates per event. Both copies are **one level**: deep-copying arbitrary caller objects inside an accessor that must never raise trades a narrow sharing bound for a wide new failure, so the bound is stated and pinned rather than closed. Freezing `Config` also turned every write into a read-modify-write, and one writer (`_ensure_sink`) runs on the orphan logging path — measured, one concurrent `info()` permanently reverted `configure()` in 268 of 2000 trials — so `_config_lock` serializes the writers while reads stay lock-free. (SPEC-034 FR-003, FR-005)
